Ping Pong Goal Keeper Tool

I built this is a simple tool with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using the Bulma framework. It allows users to practice their ping pong skills by simulating a goal keeper that moves back and forth to block shots.

To use the tool, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the goal keeper. Try to block as many shots as you can to improve your ping pong skills!

Enjoy and happy practicing!
